                <p>Synergistics FZ LLC is an innovative and young software development house based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with the objective of becoming the region’s leading mobile application developer. An objective that we seek to
achieve by being committed to our three principles of design: creativity, functionality and usability.</p>

<p>The company was co-founded by two entrepreneurs that saw the exponential growth of the mobile application
market, and its potential over the last few years globally, and locally in the United Arab Emirates. Where,
H.H Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid AlMaktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and ruler of
Dubai launched the Mobile Government Initiative late in 2013 to make all government services accessible
round-the-clock through smart phones and smart devices in line with the UAE’s smart government initiative.</p>

<p>Additionally, to the number of private organizations that have also aligned their business strategy to become
mobile, and to the number of small & medium businesses that have developed their businesses around
mobility. We work to create the most innovative mobile applications that serve our clients objectives, while
also developing our own mobile applications, which aims to fill the gaps within the app marketplace.</p>
